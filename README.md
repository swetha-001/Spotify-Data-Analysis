## Other Insights :
* Content filter is performed by identifying Number of songs with explicit content.
* Correlation of Spotify Popularity with Track Score and All-Time Rank which suggests Spotify Popularity alone doesn't strongly determine rank or score.
* Artist-Level Analysis is performed identifying Artist with highest average track score and most songs above Spotify Popularity 90.
* Songs with the highest YouTube likes which measures Engagement. 

## Most Popular song across all platforms:
1. Selected popularity metrics from multiple platforms (Spotify, YouTube, TikTok, etc.)

2. Handled missing values and normalized the data using MinMaxScaler.
   - Normalizes each metric, so one metric doesnâ€™t overpower others

3. Calculated a combined popularity score by summing or weighting the normalized values.
   - Sums them into one composite score

4. Identified the song with the highest combined score as the most popular across all platforms.
